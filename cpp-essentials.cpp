//here are some essential c++ scripts

//1. basic configuration
//these are essential to your code, and are the very first lines of a c++ file:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
//2. main function
//this is required for c++ applications, the code inside of the main function is the code that runs when you run the c++ file:
int main() {
  //your code here
}
//3. string import
//if you want to use a string variable, you first will need to import the string library:
#include <string>
//and then you can use the string variable:
string text = "hello";
